			<p id="p1">Welcome to my page! My name is Bob. I was born in Serbia in the late seventies. I grew up in a small town called Nish. I went to high school there and later on grauated and got my bachelors degree in economics. In the early 2000 I moved to Cyprus and spend two years working for the Le-Meridien Hotel in the city of Limassol. Those were challenging times for me. The life was very difficult. Spending all day at the beach, bathing in the sun, playing beach wolleyball, oh man, hard times. You can imagine how horrible it can be when the entire year the temperature outside doesn't go below 80 degrees. I was forced to enjoy and have fun. Absolutely horrific experience. I wen't there to spend only a week or two and it was so bad that i had to stay almost over two years. Anyway, all that had to end one day as I realized that working in the hotel industry will not benefit my life as I, as a youngster, thought it would. I decided to go back home.</p>

			<p id="p2">Upon my return to Serbia, I continued my education, and at the same time waited for the opportunity to move to some other, more prosperous world country. Fortunately, I was able to come to the U.S. in 2006. I became a citizen in 2014. Currently working for the DOR and going to school.</p>
